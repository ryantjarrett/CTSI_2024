   abstract = {Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are neutralizing antibodies indicated for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with early mild or moderate disease. We present the use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling that characterizes the timecourse of viral load obtained from 2,970 patients from 2 phase II clinical trials. The model was used for identification of optimal doses that would result in at least 90% of patients achieving serum drug concentrations that result in 90% of maximum drug effect (IC90) for at least 28 days. The serum IC90 (95% confidence interval) was estimated to be 4.2 (3.2–4.3) µg/mL for bamlanivimab and 12.6 (9.7–12.8) µg/mL for etesevimab. Observed clinical trial data confirmed PK and PK/PD model predictions that doses of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1,400 mg etesevimab would result in maximum reduction in viral load, with no additional effect seen at higher doses. No dose adjustment is recommended as age, sex, race, baseline viral load, and hepatic impairment did not have a significant impact on the PK of the antibodies. Earlier drug administration resulted in greater reductions in viral load, demonstrating the importance of receiving treatment as soon as possible. Relative to placebo, typical reduction in viral load over a 7-day period was estimated to be 80 or 93% (drug administered 4 days or 1 day after the onset of symptoms, respectively), P<0.0001. PK/PD modeling and simulation was pivotal throughout the drug development and emergency use authorization process.},

   abstract = {Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb), novel therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been urgently researched from the start of the pandemic. The selection of the optimal mAb candidate and therapeutic dose were expedited using open-access in silico models. The maximally effective therapeutic mAb dose was determined through two approaches; both expanded on innovative, open-science initiatives. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, incorporating physicochemical properties predictive of mAb clearance and tissue distribution, was used to estimate mAb exposure that maintained concentrations above 90% inhibitory concentration of in vitro neutralization in lung tissue for up to 4 weeks in 90% of patients. To achieve fastest viral clearance following onset of symptoms, a longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamic model was applied to estimate viral clearance as a function of drug concentration and dose. The PBPK model-based approach suggested that a clinical dose between 175 and 500 mg of bamlanivimab would maintain target mAb concentrations in the lung tissue over 28 days in 90% of patients. The viral dynamic model suggested a 700 mg dose would achieve maximum viral elimination. Taken together, the first-in-human trial (NCT04411628) conservatively proceeded with a starting therapeutic dose of 700 mg and escalated to higher doses to evaluate the upper limit of safety and tolerability. Availability of open-access codes and application of novel in silico model-based approaches supported the selection of bamlanivimab and identified the lowest dose evaluated in this study that was expected to result in the maximum therapeutic effect before the first-in-human clinical trial.},

   abstract = {Monoclonal antibody (mAb) pharmacokinetics (PK) have largely been predicted via allometric scaling with little consideration for cross-species differences in neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) affinity or clearance/distribution mechanisms. To address this, we developed a mAb physiologically-based PK model that describes the intracellular trafficking and FcRn recycling of mAbs in a human FcRn transgenic homozygous mouse and human. This model uses mAb-specific in vitro data together with species-specific FcRn tissue expression, tissue volume, and blood-flow physiology to predict mAb in vivo linear PK a priori. The model accurately predicts the terminal half-life of 90% of the mAbs investigated within a twofold error. The mechanistic nature of this model allows us to not only predict linear PK from in vitro data but also explore the PK and target binding of mAbs engineered to have pH-dependent binding to its target or FcRn and could aid in the selection of mAbs with optimal PK and pharmacodynamic properties.},

   abstract = {The scientific community is focused on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2–3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented health crisis and economic burden worldwide. Its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, a new virus in the coronavirus family, has infected hundreds of millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved over the past 2 years to increase its transmissibility as well as to evade the immunity established by previous infection and vaccination. Nevertheless, strong immune responses can be elicited by viral infection and vaccination, which have proved to be protective against the emergence of variants, particularly with respect to hospitalization or severe disease. Here, we review our current understanding of how the virus enters the host cell and how our immune system is able to defend against cell entry and infection. Neutralizing antibodies are a major component of our immune defense and have been extensively studied for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Structures of these neutralizing antibodies have provided valuable insights into epitopes that are protective against the original ancestral virus and the variants that have emerged. The molecular characterization of neutralizing epitopes as well as epitope conservation and resistance are important for design of next-generation vaccines and antibody therapeutics.},

Healthy adults (n=31) were randomized to receive a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of motavizumab- YTE or motavizumab (0.3, 3, 15, or 30 mg/kg) and followed for 240 days. Clearance of motavizumab-YTE was significantly lower (71% to 86%) and the half-life (t1/2) was 2- to 4-fold longer than with motavizumab. However, similar peak concentrations and volume-of-distribution values, indicative of similar distribution properties, were seen at all dose levels. The sustained serum concentrations of motavizumab-YTE were fully functional, as shown by RSV neutralizing activity that persisted for 240 days with motavizumab-YTE versus 90 days postdose for motavizumab. Safety and incidence of ADA were comparable between groups. In this first study of an Fc-modified monoclonal antibody in humans, motavizumab-YTE was well tolerated and exhibited an extended half-life of up to 100 days.

Here we aggregate data from randomized controlled trials assessing the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We use data on the in vivo concentration of mAb and the associated protection from COVID-19 over time to model the dose-response relationship of mAb for prophylaxis. We estimate that 50% protection from COVID-19 is achieved with a mAb concentration of 96-fold of the in vitro IC50 (95% CI: 32—285). This relationship provides a tool for predicting the prophylactic efficacy of new mAb and against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Finally, we compare the relationship between neutralization titer and protection from COVID-19 after either mAb treatment or vaccination. We find no significant difference between the 50% protective titer for mAb and vaccination, although sample sizes limited the power to detect a difference.},

   abstract = {Dengue is an important public health problem worldwide, with India contributing nearly a third of global dengue disease burden. The measurement of neutralizing antibody responses is critical for understanding dengue pathophysiology, vaccine development and evaluation. Historically, dengue virus neutralization titers were measured using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs), which were later adapted to focus reduction neutralization tests (FRNTs). Given the slow and laborious nature of both these assays, there has been interest in adapting a high-throughput flow cytometry based neutralization assay. However, flow cytometry based assays typically underestimate neutralization titers, and in situations where the titers are low they can even fail to detect neutralization activity. In this study, by evaluating graded numbers of input Vero cell numbers and viral inoculum, we optimized the flow cytometry based neutralization assay in such a way that it is sensitive and scores titers that are in concordance with focus reduction neutralization tests for each of the four dengue virus serotypes (p < 0.0001). Given that dengue is a global public health concern, and several research groups are making efforts to understand its pathophysiology and accelerate vaccine development and evaluation both in India and worldwide, our findings have timely significance for facilitating these efforts.},

   abstract = {Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4–28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7–13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.},
